# HTML Table Parser

This project parses HTML table data and exports it to CSV format.

## Description

The `web_page_parsing.py` script reads an HTML file containing table data, extracts the content from table rows and cells, and writes the parsed data to a CSV file. It handles both `<td>` and `<th>` tags and automatically cleans up whitespace.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (no external dependencies required - uses only built-in libraries)

## Files

- `web_page_parsing.py` - Main script that parses HTML and generates CSV
- `web.html` - Input HTML file containing table data
- `languages.csv` - Output CSV file (generated after running the script)

## How to Run

### Option 1: Run Locally with Python

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /workspaces/COSC_352_SPRING_2026/obaloluwa_wojuade/project02
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python web_page_parsing.py
   ```
4. Check the output file `languages.csv` for the parsed data



The script will print:
```
Done! Wrote X rows to languages.csv
```

Where X is the number of rows extracted from the HTML table.

## How It Works

1. Reads the `web.html` file
2. Parses HTML character by character to detect table tags (`<tr>`, `<td>`, `<th>`)
3. Extracts text content from table cells
4. Cleans up whitespace in cell content
5. Writes the structured data to `languages.csv`
